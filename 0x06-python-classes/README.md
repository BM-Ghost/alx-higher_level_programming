## Python Classes and Objects

This repository consists of a series of tasks focused on creating and manipulating Python classes, specifically revolving around the concept of squares and singly linked lists.

### Task Breakdown

#### Task 0: My first square
An empty class `Square` is created, serving as the initial definition of a square.

#### Task 1: Square with size
The `Square` class is expanded to include an attribute defining the size of the square.

#### Task 2: Size validation
Enhancing the `Square` class further, this task involves incorporating validation for the size attribute, ensuring it's an integer and greater than or equal to 0.

#### Task 3: Area of a square
Adding a method to calculate the area of the square within the `Square` class.

#### Task 4: Access and update private attribute
Implementing a private attribute within the `Square` class and providing accessors and mutators to modify it.

#### Task 5: Printing a square
Creating a method to print the square using the `#` character based on the size attribute within the `Square` class.

#### Task 6: Coordinates of a square
Extending the `Square` class to include attributes that represent the position of the square on a coordinate plane.

#### Task 7: Singly linked list
Introducing a `Node` class that defines the structure of a node within a singly linked list.

#### Task 8: Print Square instance
Implementing a method to print an instance of the `Square` class in a specific format.

#### Task 9: Compare 2 squares
Enabling comparison between two `Square` instances based on their respective areas.

#### Task 10: ByteCode -> Python #5
Creating a Python class named `MagicClass` that replicates the functionality of a given Python bytecode.

### Repository Link
Find the implementation of these tasks and their respective solutions at [alx-higher_level_programming](https://github.com/BM-Ghost/alx-higher_level_programming).

These tasks serve as exercises to deepen understanding of classes, object-oriented programming, data structures, and manipulation of attributes and methods within Python. Each task builds upon the previous one, expanding the capabilities of the `Square` class and introducing related concepts.
